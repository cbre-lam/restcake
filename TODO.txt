Note: This TODO file is very old, who knows.

Should warn the user if a method is a GET method and not all params are in the UriTemplate.

Test enum params for all param passing methods (uri segment, query string, request body json, request body forms encoded)

With jsonp, if the return status code is not 200, I need to make it 200, and add a status: or _status: property to the response that has the actual status code.

clean up all of the methods in RestHttpHandler that actually send a response back to the client. Make all of them hookable (virtual) so there are easy extension points.
